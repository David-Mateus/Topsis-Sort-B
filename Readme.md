# Topsis Sort B

 The TOPSIS-Sort-B is an enhanced variation of the TOPSIS-Sort method, designed to address classification and sorting problems in multiple criteria decision-making. In this method, boundary profiles are employed to determine categorization classes and to sort alternatives based on the proximity of their proximity coefficients to the established profiles.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Your CSV File:**
   - You'll see a screen to upload your CSV file containing the required data.
2. **Select the Dominant Profile:**
   - After uploading the file, you'll be prompted to select the relevant dominant profile for analysis.
3. **Specify the Number of Values in the Domain Matrix:**
   - You'll need to input the desired number of values to compose the domain matrix.
4. **Provide the Number of Weights:**
   - Next, you'll be asked to input the number of weights needed for analysis.
5. **Assign Weights to Dominant Profiles:**
   - You'll be prompted to assign a weight to each selected dominant profile.
After completing these steps, the system will be ready to process and analyze the data according to your specifications.
